Simple Moving Average (SMA): Added a 3-day SMA to smooth daily TVL fluctuations, displayed as a blue line on the chart alongside the raw TVL (green line). This helps visualize the overall trend, especially for longer periods.
Linear Regression Slope: Calculated the slope of a best-fit line through all TVL data points to determine the trend direction ("Upward", "Downward", or "Stable" if |slope| < 1000). The percentage change is shown for reference (e.g., "Downward trend (by 6.92%)").
